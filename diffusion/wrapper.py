    """Create a wrapper function for the noise prediction model.

    DPM-Solver needs to solve the continuous-time diffusion ODEs. For DPMs trained on discrete-time labels, we need to
    firstly wrap the model function to a noise prediction model that accepts the continuous time as the input.

    We support four types of the diffusion model by setting `model_type`:

        1. "noise": noise prediction model. (Trained by predicting noise).

        2. "x_start": data prediction model. (Trained by predicting the data x_0 at time 0).

        3. "v": velocity prediction model. (Trained by predicting the velocity).
            The "v" prediction is derivation detailed in Appendix D of [1], and is used in Imagen-Video [2].

                arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.02303 (2022).
    
        4. "score": marginal score function. (Trained by denoising score matching).
            Note that the score function and the noise prediction model follows a simple relationship:
            ```
                noise(x_t, t) = -sigma_t * score(x_t, t)
            ```

    We support three types of guided sampling by DPMs by setting `guidance_type`:
        1. "uncond": unconditional sampling by DPMs.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            ``

        2. "classifier": classifier guidance sampling [3] by DPMs and another classifier.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            `` 

            The input `classifier_fn` has the following format:
            ``
                classifier_fn(x, t_input, cond, **classifier_kwargs) -> logits(x, t_input, cond)
            ``

                in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 34, 2021, pp. 8780-8794.

        3. "classifier-free": classifier-free guidance sampling by conditional DPMs.
            The input `model` has the following format:
            ``
                model(x, t_input, cond, **model_kwargs) -> noise | x_start | v | score
            `` 
            And if cond == `unconditional_condition`, the model output is the unconditional DPM output.

                arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.12598 (2022).
        

    The `t_input` is the time label of the model, which may be discrete-time labels (i.e. 0 to 999)
    or continuous-time labels (i.e. epsilon to T).

    We wrap the model function to accept only `x` and `t_continuous` as inputs, and outputs the predicted noise:
    ``
        def model_fn(x, t_continuous) -> noise:
            t_input = get_model_input_time(t_continuous)
            return noise_pred(model, x, t_input, **model_kwargs)         
    ``
    where `t_continuous` is the continuous time labels (i.e. epsilon to T). And we use `model_fn` for DPM-Solver.
